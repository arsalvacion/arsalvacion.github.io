    "title": "Soil Erosion Modeling Under Future Climate Change: A case study in Marinduque Island, Philippines",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSoil erosion and climate change are two pressing problems affecting both developed and developing countries across the globe. In the case of the Philippines, these two environmental problems are of great importance. The island of Marinduque in the Philippines is identified as one of the soil erosion hotspots in the country. Previous soil erosion modeling studies in the province have shown that a large portion of the province is at risk of soil erosion. This chapter aims to assess potential changes in erosion risk in the province under future climate change conditions. Based on the results, varying changes but most increase in annual rainfall is projected for the province of Marinduque under future climate conditions. These projected increases in annual rainfall have resulted in an increase in erosion rates, especially in barren lands and areas with steep slopes of the province."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nContamination of crops by aflatoxins (AFs) is a real risk in the South-Eastern USA. Contamination risk at the county level based on soil type and weather in different years has been investigated. However, defining AFs contamination risk zones within fields has not yet been attempted. Drought conditions, particularly within the month of June have been linked to high levels of AFs contamination at the county level. Soil characteristics and topography are the factors influencing drought status that vary most within fields. Here, soil, plant, topography and remotely sensed information are used to define AFs contamination risk zones within two fields using different approaches. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were used to indicate potential droughty areas and thermal IR data from LandSat imagery were used to identify hot areas. Topographic variables were also computed. Comparison tests showed that a combination of regression analysis of soil, plant and imagery data and bi-variate local Moran’s I analysis of NDVI and Thermal IR data from several years was the best way to define zones for mean and maximum AFs levels. An approach based on principal components analysis of soil, plant and imagery data from 2010, a high-risk year, was best for defining zones for minimum AFs levels. Analysis of imagery from several years suggested that the zones are likely to be relatively stable in time and could be defined using only freely available sensor, topographic and soil series data. Once defined, such zones can be managed to increase profitability and reduce waste."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSignificant fish kills in Taal Lake in Talisay, Batangas Province, which created major economic setbacks in the area, were mainly attributed to lake overturn. A predictive model of climate-induced lake overturn for the lake was developed using a combination of data exploratory analysis, correlation, autocorrelation, logistic regression, and Bayesian causality modeling. Climatic data and reports of fish kill events in the lake were analyzed for trends and patterns. Statistical tests of possible relationships were done via logistic regression modeling, while stepwise logistic regression method was applied to identify climatic variables that significantly affected lake overturn.\nWind speed and minimum air temperature were the two significant climatic variables found to have induced lake overturn. The results of the logistic probability analyses were transformed to develop the conditional probability tables (CPT) required in the development of the model."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIslands are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and extreme weather events due to their physical size, remoteness, and limited resources. This paper measured village-level drought risk in Marinduque, Philippines using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and fuzzy logic. Standard Precipitation Index was used to measure drought hazards in the province utilizing publicly available rainfall. Principal component analysis was used to derive the drought hazard index from SPI-calculated drought magnitude and total drought event at different time scales. The fuzzy logic approach was used to delineate the physical vulnerability of the province to drought. The social vulnerability index was also derived from the socioeconomic and demographic data of Marinduque using PCA. Based on the results, villages with high drought risk were found in the northwest and eastern portion of the province. The results showed that topography and climate influence the hazard and physical vulnerability to drought in the area. Villages in high mountainous regions, and areas with low rainfall have higher drought hazard and physical vulnerability scores. Meanwhile, villages with high social vulnerability are also those with a large population of women, the elderly, and households engage in agriculture."
