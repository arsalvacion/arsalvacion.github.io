## About Me

I am a Research Fellow in Geospatial Data Science at the Curtin for Agribusiness Profitability (C4AP) of the [Centre for Crop and Disease Management](https://www.ccdm.com.au/people/arnold-salvacion/), Curtin University. I lead and support the C4AP data scientists and analysts in the development of different data pipelines (i.e., ingestion, cleaning, and visualization) to build the Agri-analytics Hub for the Western Australian grain farmers.

I received a PhD (by Research) in Environmental Science from the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB). Prior to joining Curtin, I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Community and Environmental Resource Planning (DCERP), College of Human Ecology (CHE), UPLB. I am the founding Editor-in-Chief of the [Journal of Human Ecology and Sustainability](https://jhes.uplb.edu.ph/). I also serve as reviewer for numerous journals and sit on the editorial board of [SN Social Sciences](https://link.springer.com/journal/43545), [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/arsalvacion/), and [Spatial Information Research](https://link.springer.com/journal/41324/editors).
